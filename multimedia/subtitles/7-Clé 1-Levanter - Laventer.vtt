00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:19.880
I thought I could reach if I kept chasing 
I’ve never even doubted

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:26.420
Even though I held you as I imagined 
Even though I held you tight with two hands

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:33.100
In my arms only the emptiness remains 
By wandering around

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:38.620
I finally realized 
That I have to let go of you

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:45.180
(Oh) I’ve been deceiving myself
(Oh) The moment I wake up from the dream I’ve endured

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.540
(Oh) I feel the light flooding in

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:56.860
I wanna be myself (I don’t care)
Even if it’s still strange (Just don’t care)

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:03.380
As soon as I broke away from you, I can see myself 
Everything, all before my eyes

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:09.420
Now I know (Now I know)
The one I needed has been me

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:17.520
I walk as my feet take me
I feel the light, I feel the light

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.160
I was constantly running to you 
Then I realized

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:27.200
That my everything was towards you 
The more I got close to you

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.000
The more I lost myself

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.800
Like the fallen leaves under the tree 
Even if I eventually get stamped on in the snow

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.740
Now I rise above you looking for the spring

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.860
The remaining feelings are blown away by the wind

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:49.220
(Oh) The tunnel that locked me up in the dream 
(Oh) The moment I get out of it

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:54.460
(Oh) I feel the light flooding in

00:01:54.460 --> 00:02:00.660
I wanna be myself (I don’t care)
Even if it’s still strange  (Just don’t care)

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:07.520
As soon as I broke away from you, I can see myself 
Everything, all before my eyes

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:13.560
Now I know (Now I know)
The one I needed has been me

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:21.340
I walk as my feet take me 
I feel the light, I feel the light

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:34.220
I was afraid of letting go of you 
But I had to let go of you

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:36.780
It’s all good now

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:55.360
I wanna be myself (I don’t care)
Even if it’s still strange (Just don’t care)

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:03.120
After breaking away from you I can see 
Everything, all before my eyes
