Breaking News.

00:00:03.996 --> 00:00:07.224
After losing his voice from the sound monster attacks,

00:00:07.224 --> 00:00:10.477
Santa has hired a substitute to work in his place while he undergoes hospital treatment.

00:00:10.477 --> 00:00:13.539
We wait in anticipation to see if the specially employed substitute Santa

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:16.458
will be able to spread joy to children all around the world.

00:00:17.059 --> 00:00:17.701
Let’s get ready

00:00:17.701 --> 00:00:18.494
Huh?

00:00:18.494 --> 00:00:19.578
What, what again

00:00:19.578 --> 00:00:20.278
Oh gosh

00:00:31.415 --> 00:00:34.167
(It’s Christmas Eve)

00:00:34.167 --> 00:00:37.395
The overnight snow is pretty for just a second

00:00:37.395 --> 00:00:38.371
Romantic? Not

00:00:38.372 --> 00:00:39.890
Look how fast the selfish cars made it turn black

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:41.767
It's even hard to walk in, it's not a snowfield, it's a mud flat

00:00:41.767 --> 00:00:43.585
My pants are wet to the knee

00:00:43.585 --> 00:00:45.261
After walking for a bit, I topple over

00:00:45.262 --> 00:00:46.922
I used to wish it would be special on this special day

00:00:46.922 --> 00:00:48.631
But not anymore, I only hope nothing ever happens

00:00:48.632 --> 00:00:51.968
As I lay around at home, my eyes get swollen

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:54.772
Will the snowman that I made yesterday be okay?

00:00:54.772 --> 00:00:55.638
Ouch, that stings

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:57.158
Cut by the biting wind snikt snikt

00:00:57.158 --> 00:00:58.808
Brrr trembling voice

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:00.527
What do you mean colorful, I can't see anything

00:01:00.527 --> 00:01:02.270
Cough cough cough I cough while rapping

00:01:02.271 --> 00:01:05.357
Jack Frost coming for y’all, run run

00:01:05.357 --> 00:01:09.486
The holiday that freezes us to the bone, silence

00:01:09.486 --> 00:01:12.197
There’s nothing special

00:01:12.197 --> 00:01:15.033
Why did everyone wait for so long?

00:01:15.033 --> 00:01:18.169
Christmas EveL

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:19.245
(Merry Christmas)

00:01:19.246 --> 00:01:21.665
Jingle jingle jingle all the way

00:01:21.665 --> 00:01:22.832
You got me spinning

00:01:22.833 --> 00:01:25.043
Turning round and round and round

00:01:25.043 --> 00:01:26.210
Christmas on the ice

00:01:26.211 --> 00:01:29.589
Risky and chaotic

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.008
I don’t need no presents

00:01:31.008 --> 00:01:33.511
Crossing out X-MAS

00:01:33.511 --> 00:01:36.846
It’s getting colder, I’m burning my anxiety, not firewood

00:01:36.847 --> 00:01:40.308
Thanks to the slippery road, there’s more traffic. Thanks so much, winter

00:01:40.309 --> 00:01:42.060
I can see my breath, my nose turns red

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.728
Only the parts I dressed up in layers are hot

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:47.107
What are you shy about? eh Your ears turned red (Oh man)

00:01:47.107 --> 00:01:50.485
Who says it's sparkling bright, your eyes must be steamy - pretty good quality filter

00:01:50.485 --> 00:01:53.863
Oh move out of the way out of the way, when you squeeze your snowed on coat there go 5 liters

00:01:53.864 --> 00:01:57.242
I hate to see those people who stick to each other because it's cold

00:01:57.242 --> 00:02:00.495
I don't get a single call, only junk messages. I hate everyone

00:02:00.495 --> 00:02:03.748
Jack Frost coming for y’all, run run

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:07.635
The holiday that freezes us to the bone, silence

00:02:07.635 --> 00:02:10.505
There’s nothing special

00:02:10.505 --> 00:02:13.382
Why did everyone wait for so long?

00:02:13.383 --> 00:02:16.435

Crossing out X-MAS

00:02:31.401 --> 00:02:38.282
I secretly tiptoe onto the chimney

00:02:38.283 --> 00:02:44.216
Gyro Drop thud reality check Christmas EveL

00:02:51.838 --> 00:02:52.738

One, two

00:02:53.407 --> 00:02:54.207
Step Out

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.297
You’re not Santa!

00:03:00.297 --> 00:03:03.308

Today is a special day, no one can steal it

00:03:10.124 --> 00:03:12.017
Shadows are taking over me

00:03:12.017 --> 00:03:13.818
Let me sing a Christmas song

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:17.456
