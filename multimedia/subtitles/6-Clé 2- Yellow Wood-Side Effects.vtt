00:00:40.089 --> 00:00:43.089
I threw myself with trust in me

00:00:43.089 --> 00:00:47.289
But why am I being swayed

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:50.489
I threw myself with trust in me

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:54.690
But why am I just being hurt

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.200
Get out of the way you all 
(actually I am)

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.030
I’m right 
(scared)

00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:59.630
You all wait and see
(can I do it?)

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:01.730
I’m scared that I might not keep these words

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:03.630
Why am I keep changing?

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:05.530
My inside and outside are both changing

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:07.230
I’m being colored now

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:09.430
My head hurts

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.300
My head hurts

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.100
My head hurts

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.800
I threw myself with trust in me

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.900
But why am I being swayed

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.000
I threw myself with trust in me

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.900
But why am I just being hurt

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.500
Wait a second, this is weird, my vision’s blurry

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.000
Why doesn’t it end? I keep hearing disturbing noises

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.700
Even here, I kept
Believing in winning over everything with my will to fight

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.300
Bravado can’t last anymore

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.300
Maybe it hurts more because I thought it’d be easy

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.800
I won’t change, always Yeh
I used to shout that, but why am I

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.300
According to my surroundings
Countlessly being changed

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.600
Depending on which person got on my nerves

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.100
Why does my reaction change?

00:02:04.104 --> 00:02:05.604
I used to move to the groove only when I liked them

00:02:05.604 --> 00:02:08.104
But now I’m following other people
Will my taste change also?

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:10.300
My head hurts

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.700
My head hurts

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:24.800
My head hurts

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.100
I swallow pills called baseless confidence 
(gulp gulp)

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.800
Maybe I took them so many, now I’m feeling worried than confident 
(brr brr brr brr)

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.500
Everything is being changed, from 1 to 10 
(more and more)

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.300
The side effects kicking in against my will
No no no no

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.400
Wait a second, this is weird, my vision’s blurry

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.900
Why doesn’t it end? I keep hearing disturbing noises

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.400
Even here, I kept

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.500
Believing in winning over everything with my will to fight

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.200
Bravado can’t last anymore

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.200
Maybe it hurts more because I thought it’d be easy

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.400
My head hurts

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.100
My head hurts

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.800
My head hurts

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.300
My head hurts
