00:00:05.351 --> 00:00:06.326
“Yes, sir and ma'am”

00:00:06.383 --> 00:00:07.698
Welcome!

00:00:07.722 --> 00:00:10.688
It’s easy to choose what you want in this store

00:00:10.713 --> 00:00:13.426
Anything on the menu will satisfy your all five senses

00:00:13.451 --> 00:00:16.006
Even passing Travelers, pigeons,

00:00:16.031 --> 00:00:18.704
Magpies, and crows

00:00:18.744 --> 00:00:20.530
Cooking a sauce, get all you want

00:00:20.555 --> 00:00:21.919
Savor it, lick it, say it, bon

00:00:21.958 --> 00:00:23.466
Taste so good, everyone loves it

00:00:23.491 --> 00:00:24.974
But it all tastes strong

00:00:24.999 --> 00:00:26.800
I want it till I serve them all

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:27.871
I do my research, cross boundaries

00:00:27.896 --> 00:00:30.292
No limits, like a creator, I make sound

00:00:30.331 --> 00:00:33.665
We just keep on making new things

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.985
Because we’re one of a kind

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.676
No one can copy us, our own game

00:00:39.701 --> 00:00:42.493
From the start, it’s all ours

00:00:42.533 --> 00:00:45.192
Even if you go away for a moment

00:00:45.217 --> 00:00:48.247
You will look for it again

00:00:48.272 --> 00:00:52.096
Hottest menus that will never cool off

00:00:52.121 --> 00:00:53.644
Imprint those flavors on your palate

00:00:53.669 --> 00:00:55.231

I just wanna taste it, make it hot

00:01:11.801 --> 00:01:15.030
On a new grill, cook this track

00:01:15.055 --> 00:01:16.687
Choose the menu, call me up

00:01:16.712 --> 00:01:18.196

Cookin’ like a chef I’m a 5 star Michelin

00:01:22.765 --> 00:01:25.755
Reached the peak of “taste” I see it illusion

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.791
Whoo I’ve never felt this way before

00:01:28.816 --> 00:01:31.944
You will be shocked, gonna shock, instant electric shock

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:34.742
All the locks unlock

00:01:34.767 --> 00:01:37.936
Idea bank, empty your head, empty it

00:01:37.961 --> 00:01:40.656
Wonder what’s our secret ingredient

00:01:40.681 --> 00:01:43.419
We don’t use such a thing

00:01:43.444 --> 00:01:46.974
We just keep on making new things

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:49.339
Because we’re one of a kind

Don’t mind the other, put more

00:02:14.721 --> 00:02:17.843
Don’t hesitate, pour more

00:02:17.868 --> 00:02:19.272
