Stray kids everywhere all around the world

00:01:34.627 --> 00:01:37.161
Their footsteps are getting louder

00:01:37.161 --> 00:01:39.571
They just look us as a bunch of troublemakers

00:01:39.571 --> 00:01:42.255
It won’t be an easy one to change their views

00:01:42.255 --> 00:01:44.795
But we won’t get down on misconceptions and bias

00:01:44.795 --> 00:01:47.465
It’s our mission to prove who we are

00:01:47.465 --> 00:01:50.207
They say “You’re different from me, so leave here”

00:01:50.207 --> 00:01:52.867
But you need to know that being different is not being wrong

00:01:52.867 --> 00:01:55.923
Soon it’ll be time for jealousy, we’re at the district where a small light becomes huge
