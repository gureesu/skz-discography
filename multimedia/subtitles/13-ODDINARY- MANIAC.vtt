00:00:14.415 --> 00:00:14.982
Let’s go

00:00:14.982 --> 00:00:17.517
Relax everyone, stop pretending to be normal

00:00:17.518 --> 00:00:20.145
All of your smiles look weird

00:00:20.145 --> 00:00:22.939
When the Lock is released, we’re all the same

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:25.025
Your eyes can't fool me, ho

00:00:25.025 --> 00:00:27.152
The real self has been released

00:00:27.152 --> 00:00:29.904
Barely holding on

00:00:29.905 --> 00:00:32.699
After blinking once, back

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:36.244
Again, back to cosplaying as what society defines normal to be ppow

00:00:36.245 --> 00:00:38.997
Mash up, mind blown put my mind on back up

00:00:38.997 --> 00:00:41.582
Prototype, on the inside I’m always a freaky monster

00:00:41.583 --> 00:00:44.168
Kindness is no longer trending, now rotten

00:00:44.169 --> 00:00:46.713
You can backbite me as much as you want, I'll ignore them anyway

00:00:46.713 --> 00:00:47.588
Poppin’

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:50.133
If you think I'm just pure and innocent, you're wrong

00:00:50.133 --> 00:00:52.802
When a favor continues, people think it’s their right, toxic

00:00:52.803 --> 00:00:55.003
This is what drives me crazy, warning

00:00:57.558 --> 00:00:58.675
MANIAC

00:00:58.675 --> 00:01:01.352
Going crazy, like I have a loose screw MANIAC

00:01:01.353 --> 00:01:02.979
Spinning, going crazy

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:05.607
MANIAC Walk like Frankenstein

00:01:05.607 --> 00:01:08.359
MANIAC MANIAC Haha

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:09.360
MANIAC (Oh)

00:01:09.361 --> 00:01:12.113
Laugh like I have a loose screw MANIAC (You can’t stop the smoke)

00:01:12.114 --> 00:01:13.615
Spinning, going crazy (Thick as fog)

00:01:13.615 --> 00:01:16.409
MANIAC a MANIAC group (We’re MANIACS)

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:18.830
MANIAC MANIAC

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:20.870
Like the seam of a torn doll

00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:25.126
Eventually, you’ll expose your real self

00:01:25.127 --> 00:01:26.628
In this not easy life

00:01:26.628 --> 00:01:29.631
It ain't "live" it's "holding on" yeah

00:01:29.631 --> 00:01:32.175
Relax everyone, stop pretending to be normal

00:01:32.175 --> 00:01:34.802
All of your smiles no fresh

00:01:34.803 --> 00:01:37.514
When the Locket is open, we’re all the same

00:01:37.514 --> 00:01:40.225
Your eyes can't fool me, ho

00:01:40.225 --> 00:01:42.602
This street I'm walking on is a minefield

00:01:42.602 --> 00:01:45.438
Like a dormant volcano, never know when it'll all explode

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:48.066
Never know when the calm winds will change

00:01:48.066 --> 00:01:50.610
Everyone lives hiding themselves like a sealed tornado

00:01:50.611 --> 00:01:51.570
Poppin’

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.155
If you think I'm just pure and innocent, you're wrong

00:01:54.156 --> 00:01:56.783
When a favor continues, people think it’s their right, toxic

00:01:56.783 --> 00:01:59.083

Laugh like I have a loose screw MANIAC (You can’t stop the smoke)

00:02:16.094 --> 00:02:17.637

00:02:23.226 --> 00:02:26.145
Eyes filled with lunatic

00:02:26.146 --> 00:02:28.898
All senses are tense

00:02:28.899 --> 00:02:33.945
Locked up while wrapped up in that pretty package

00:02:33.945 --> 00:02:38.074
As time goes by, it'll eventually be revealed

00:02:38.075 --> 00:02:44.323
The inner self that was hidden yeah

00:02:44.323 --> 00:02:45.823
MANIAC

MANIAC (Oh)

00:02:55.967 --> 00:02:58.719
Laugh like I have a loose screw MANIAC (You can’t stop the smoke)

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.263
