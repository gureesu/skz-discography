00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.300
Across the mountain across the mountain
Across the river across the river

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.608
Across the mountain and
range across the river and the ocean

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.340
Across all of it and the next

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:14.500
It’s not hard, in this rough jungle
It was me who ran into it, I’m okay

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:22.900
We goin’ higher in the next city
Looking down the buildings, Fly all day

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.350
Woah-oh-oh woah-oh-oh woah-oh Higher
I’m going up over there

00:01:27.375 --> 00:01:31.300
Woah-oh-oh woah-oh-oh woah-oh Higher 
I’m going to fly higher

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:35.000
Woah-oh-oh woah-oh-oh woah-oh Higher
I’m going up over there

00:01:35.024 --> 00:01:38.524
Woah-oh-oh woah-oh-oh woah-oh Higher
 I’m going to fly higher

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.600
There’s no way because it’s my first time
I was daring because it’s my first time

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.448
That it was my first time
became a weapon

00:01:44.473 --> 00:01:46.100
It’s my first time, my first time, all of them

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.100
Poison, trap, toadstool you can set them up

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.900
I’ll survive in the end, whatever it takes

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.000
I know your traps, you set them up 
and I stomp on them tougher

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.700
There’s only one answer, you just have to open it

00:02:08.473 --> 00:02:16.173
It’s not hard, in this rough jungle
It was me who ran into it, I’m okay

00:02:16.173 --> 00:02:23.673
We goin’ higher in the next city
Looking down the buildings, Fly all day

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.531
Woah-oh-oh woah-oh-oh woah-oh Higher
 I’m going up over there

00:02:28.556 --> 00:02:32.300
Woah-oh-oh woah-oh-oh woah-oh Higher
I’m going to fly higher

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.728
Woah-oh-oh woah-oh-oh woah-oh Higher
I’m going up over there

00:02:35.753 --> 00:02:39.100
Woah-oh-oh woah-oh-oh woah-oh Higher
I’m going to fly higher

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:46.500
It’s not hard, in this roughk jungle
It was me who ran into it, I’m okay

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:54.500
We goin’ higher in the next city
Looking down the buildings, Fly all day

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.700
Lots of thorny vines, need to push down my cuts
But there’s no time to rest

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.500
I’m alright, I’m holding on and I keep on going
I just need to look ahead and run

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:03.700
Run through the maze like a beast

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:04.800
I’m avoiding all the familiar paths

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.300
Though inexperienced, it’s a new challenge

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.820
Imma Bear Grylls anything that blocks my dream I’m going to eat it up

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:10.120
I run, it’s the adventure for my dream

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:32.200
It’s not hard, in this rough jungle
It was me who ran into it, I’m okay

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:39.700
We goin’ higher in the next city
Looking down the buildings, Fly all day

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:47.700
It’s not hard, in this rough jungle
It was me who ran into it, I’m okay

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:55.000
We goin’ higher in the next city
Looking down the buildings, Fly all day

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.750
Woah-oh-oh woah-oh-oh woah-oh Higher 
I’m going up over there

00:03:59.775 --> 00:04:03.500
Woah-oh-oh woah-oh-oh woah-oh Higher
I’m going to fly higher

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.250
Woah-oh-oh woah-oh-oh woah-oh Higher
I’m going up over there

00:04:07.275 --> 00:04:11.024
Woah-oh-oh woah-oh-oh woah-oh Higher
I’m going to fly higher
