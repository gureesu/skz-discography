00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:31.042
NaNaNaNaNaNa

00:00:31.042 --> 00:00:32.263
Something is off

00:00:32.263 --> 00:00:37.083
NaNaNaNaNaNa

00:00:37.083 --> 00:00:38.370
Yeah this is it, Let’s go

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.389
NaNaNaNaNaNa

00:00:43.389 --> 00:00:47.747
I want to be like him, I’m jealous Yes I’m,
jealous Yes I’m

00:00:47.747 --> 00:00:50.965
If I was even half of half as him I’d be happy

00:00:50.965 --> 00:00:54.002
It’s funny, funny that I’m

00:00:54.002 --> 00:00:56.732
Comparing myself with someone, it’s funny

00:00:56.732 --> 00:00:59.346
Don’t do that, don’t do that

00:00:59.346 --> 00:01:02.790
Such comparison is meaningless

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:05.700
Don’t do that, Stop it now

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.543
You just have to go on your own way

00:01:08.543 --> 00:01:11.444
Though I don’t want to admit it

00:01:11.444 --> 00:01:14.662
I just naturally see others around me

00:01:14.662 --> 00:01:18.469
Going ahead doesn’t mean you’re going to get there first, Baby

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:20.485
Look at it from afar, Take your time

00:01:20.485 --> 00:01:22.535
There’s no need to rush, My Pace

00:01:22.535 --> 00:01:24.245
Don’t compare yourself with others

00:01:24.245 --> 00:01:26.705
It’s okay to run slower

00:01:26.705 --> 00:01:28.965
Just follow my lane, My lane

00:01:28.965 --> 00:01:30.575
Take it easy

00:01:30.575 --> 00:01:33.105
Just look ahead and run

00:01:33.105 --> 00:01:34.275
You ready, Let’s go

00:01:34.275 --> 00:01:38.955
NaNaNaNaNaNa

00:01:38.955 --> 00:01:40.285
Just stay in my lane

00:01:40.285 --> 00:01:45.235
NaNaNaNaNaNa

00:01:45.235 --> 00:01:46.865
But then again

00:01:46.865 --> 00:01:50.457
I look at others and then I look at myself

00:01:50.457 --> 00:01:53.055
They seem to be better than me by at least a thing

00:01:53.055 --> 00:01:56.295
Why’s that why’s that

00:01:56.295 --> 00:01:58.995
I keep going back at it without knowing

00:01:58.995 --> 00:02:01.285
I have to keep choosing though I don’t know, this or that

00:02:01.285 --> 00:02:04.490
Should I try it am I falling behind, the anxiety is killing me

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:05.597
Look at them, look at them

00:02:05.597 --> 00:02:07.061
I’m different from them, them

00:02:07.061 --> 00:02:10.561
Though I say that but I have my desire full in my empty glass

00:02:10.561 --> 00:02:13.311
Though I don’t want to admit it

00:02:13.311 --> 00:02:16.661
I just naturally see others around me

00:02:16.661 --> 00:02:20.401
Going ahead doesn’t mean you’re going to get there first, Baby

00:02:20.401 --> 00:02:22.501
Look at it from afar, Take your time

00:02:22.501 --> 00:02:24.551
There’s no need to rush, My Pace

00:02:24.551 --> 00:02:26.321
Don’t compare yourself with others

00:02:26.321 --> 00:02:28.761
It’s okay to run slower

00:02:28.761 --> 00:02:30.751
Just follow my lane, My lane

00:02:30.751 --> 00:02:32.491
Take it easy

00:02:32.491 --> 00:02:35.077
Just look ahead and run

00:02:47.112 --> 00:02:50.728
I don't know where my destination is yet

00:02:50.728 --> 00:02:52.422
I don't know

00:02:52.422 --> 00:02:56.828
I don’t know how I’d look like at the finish line, I want to know

00:02:56.828 --> 00:02:58.817
I want to know

00:02:58.817 --> 00:03:01.417
But for now I run on the road ahead of me

00:03:01.417 --> 00:03:04.977
I’ll decide on the next fork

00:03:04.977 --> 00:03:08.403
Until then, I’m not looking at others

00:03:08.403 --> 00:03:11.672
Don’t forget My speed, My lane, My pace

00:03:12.842 --> 00:03:14.832
There’s no need to rush, My Pace

00:03:14.832 --> 00:03:16.342
Don’t compare yourself with others

00:03:16.342 --> 00:03:19.152
It’s okay to run slower

00:03:19.152 --> 00:03:21.162
Just follow my lane, My lane

00:03:21.162 --> 00:03:22.782
Take it easy

00:03:22.782 --> 00:03:24.743
Just run and look ahead

00:03:24.743 --> 00:03:26.270
You ready, Let’s go

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:31.169
NaNaNaNaNaNa

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:33.066
Just stay in my lane

00:03:33.066 --> 00:03:38.405
NaNaNaNaNaNa
