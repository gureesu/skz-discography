00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:11.890
My life’s at a rock bottom’s cliff, I’m walking in a dark tunnel

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:20.459
I'm holding up this cruel, dreadful day alone

00:00:20.459 --> 00:00:23.669
My school hallway is fading away, on this unfamiliar way

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:26.559
I’m so unlucky, I don’t have any map to tell me whether this road is right

00:00:26.559 --> 00:00:30.889
There's no way to go up, what I’ve been through is a maze I never want to go back to

00:00:30.889 --> 00:00:33.309
I’m comforting myself shedding bloody sweats instead of bloody tears

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:36.209
They tell me such hills are just passing showers

00:00:36.209 --> 00:00:39.309
If you want success, put snares that are called failures

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:42.539
So yes, I bite the baits that are called pain

00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:45.759
I’m wandering around, with my exhausted wings of passions temporarily folded

00:00:45.759 --> 00:00:50.159
My life’s at a rock bottom’s cliff, I’m walking in a dark tunnel

00:00:50.159 --> 00:00:56.519
I'm holding up this cruel, dreadful day alone

00:00:56.519 --> 00:01:04.019
Though I reach out my hand, there’s nobody to hold it

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:10.318
They’re going up riding on my pain, my tears

00:01:10.318 --> 00:01:16.795
I'm on a Hellevator

00:01:16.795 --> 00:01:22.595
My Hellevator

00:01:22.595 --> 00:01:29.085
I'm on a Hellevator

00:01:29.085 --> 00:01:35.295
My Hellevator

00:01:35.295 --> 00:01:42.430
I'm on a Hellevator

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:45.390
There’s nothing for me, nobody really cares about me

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.080
No worries for me, just stone cold “Give up on your nonsense dreams”

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.360
Their words on giving up hit my ears, my despair only gets bigger

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.230
Covering the sky called hope with the hands of the people beside me

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:58.150
I’m praying for myself to hold on, to save myself from their unkind stares

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:00.560
They’re arguing if I’m crazy or not, I’ll be somebody’s clown even if I make it through

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.780
that’s what you’re going to be, stop trying to be a singer

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.230
I push myself through more hearing them talk

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:11.950
My life’s at a rock bottom’s cliff, I’m walking in a dark tunnel

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:18.040
I'm holding up this cruel, dreadful day alone

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:24.320
Though I reach out  my hand, there’s nobody to hold it

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:31.736
They’re going up riding on my pain, my tears

00:02:31.736 --> 00:02:37.746
I'm on a Hellevator

00:02:37.746 --> 00:02:44.216
My Hellevator

00:02:44.216 --> 00:02:50.386
I'm on a Hellevator

00:02:50.386 --> 00:02:56.606
My Hellevator

00:02:56.606 --> 00:02:58.380
I'm on a Hellevator

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.180
I’m going to find out where the exit is

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.999
To save me from being locked in the darkness

00:03:03.999 --> 00:03:07.149
I frantically try to, run away

00:03:07.149 --> 00:03:10.289
I’m on the Hellevator, I’m going up

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:12.759
I’m escaping my dark past, lighting up my dark road ahead

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:16.099
I run as I could forget those tedious moments

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:18.439
The bell of the new beginning that they’ve been ignoring rings

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:37.393
I got on my Hellevator that’ll hold my hand and take me to the penthouse

00:03:37.393 --> 00:03:42.993
I'm on a Hellevator

00:03:42.993 --> 00:03:48.883
My Hellevator

00:03:48.883 --> 00:03:50.149
I'm on a Hellevator
