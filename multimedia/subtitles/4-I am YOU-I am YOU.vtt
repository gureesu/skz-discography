00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:54.017
You filled the void in me

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.510
You can fill the void in me

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.760
Just you being by my side

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:03.500
Helps me a lot

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.540
I used to just say thanks but now I’m reaching out to you

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.040
With you holding my hand I can shout a bigger dream

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.720
If I could do anything for you I’d do it no matter what

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.100
If you could shine brighter, I’d be the dark

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.260
I’ll be by your side

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.720
Will you be where I am

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.860
It’s too cold outside, to be alone by myself

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:30.540
It’s warm here, maybe because you’re here

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.060
I am YOU, I see me in you

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.460
I feel it when I’m with you

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:41.660
In the same space, in the same time

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:44.000
I can do anything

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:47.020
I found YOU, I found me in you

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.560
I see myself in there

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:53.900
In the same space, in the same time

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.660
Let me run, let me run, let me run along with YOU

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.960
You reflected myself I didn’t know

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:04.320
I was wandering alone because I didn’t know myself

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.420
But at some point I can see it through the window

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.640
As you’re spending the same time and the same days with me

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.200
My question and your answer fit like puzzle pieces

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.720
We’re finding the overlapping parts of our problems

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.160
Our chemistry is fantastic, Every moment it’s perfect with you

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.620
I see myself through you and you see yourself through me, it’s amazing

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.300
I’ll be by your side

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.500
Will you be where I am

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:34.020
It’s too cold outside, to be alone by myself

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.960
It’s warm here, maybe because you’re here

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:40.000
