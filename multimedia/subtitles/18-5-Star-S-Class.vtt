00:00:12.438 --> 00:00:14.448
This is Seoul City

00:00:14.448 --> 00:00:16.758
Numerous miracles have come true

00:00:16.758 --> 00:00:21.118
A special star rises among the hidden stars

00:00:22.156 --> 00:00:26.727
Full of odd things, never changes

00:00:26.727 --> 00:00:29.527
A bustling street

00:00:31.381 --> 00:00:33.491
Everything that gets in the way on the streets

00:00:33.492 --> 00:00:35.869
Clean it up clean it up, get back

00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:38.204
A can that's shiny on the outside, empty on the inside

00:00:38.205 --> 00:00:40.265
Kick it kick it kick it

00:00:40.265 --> 00:00:44.002
Swerving, I’m speeding on Serpent Road

00:00:44.002 --> 00:00:46.754
Luxurious like I’m an S-Class

00:00:46.755 --> 00:00:49.048
Best of the best on First Class

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:51.301
I’m up above the world so high

00:00:51.301 --> 00:00:53.636
I’ll be there shining day and night

00:00:53.637 --> 00:00:57.349
They wonder how my spotlight is so bright

00:00:57.349 --> 00:00:58.266
Counting stars

00:00:58.267 --> 00:01:02.938
The most special star, star, star, star, star, star, the odd one, That’s me

00:01:02.938 --> 00:01:06.775
All, all, all, all, all, all sorts of things are my work

(Bling Bling)

00:01:07.401 --> 00:01:08.151
Everyday

00:01:08.151 --> 00:01:10.444
Flashy, flashy

00:01:10.445 --> 00:01:12.572

I take big hip-hop steps, being special is my specialty

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.084
I come and go on special episodes as if it’s my house

00:01:24.084 --> 00:01:25.960
I don’t envy studios, got the VIP room

00:01:25.961 --> 00:01:28.588
Swarming with unique features

00:01:28.589 --> 00:01:31.216
The nobodies who look around carelessly

00:01:31.216 --> 00:01:34.135
have a habit of jumping on anything that’s shiny no no

00:01:34.136 --> 00:01:36.137
Be the one to shine instead of chasing after what’s shiny

00:01:36.138 --> 00:01:38.890
That’s much easier to show off, Shine like a diamond k?

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.643
Swerving, I’m speeding on Serpent Road

00:01:42.644 --> 00:01:45.229

Stray Kids, I’ve got special forces behind me

00:02:36.932 --> 00:02:39.284
Being on Stage, that itself is special already

00:02:39.284 --> 00:02:41.452
We don’t need an audience for the festival

00:02:41.453 --> 00:02:43.830
No need for restrictions when letting things loose

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.082
Limited Edition, what’s unique becomes special

00:02:46.083 --> 00:02:48.543
Make what’s opaque clear, reflect upon it over and over again

00:02:48.543 --> 00:02:50.711
Energy stands out, audience is immersed
