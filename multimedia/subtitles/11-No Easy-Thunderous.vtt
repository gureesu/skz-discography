00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:12.162
Oh so they call me, the one shouting oh

00:00:12.162 --> 00:00:14.639
Changbin, I choose my own path

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:18.552
Attitude tough, like a runway train going recklessly down the track ey

00:00:18.552 --> 00:00:21.438
By a fierce hurricane, umbrellas flip inside-out

00:00:21.438 --> 00:00:23.823
The faultfinder's last day, Haha serves them right

00:00:23.824 --> 00:00:26.635
Go back woodcutter, there's nothing to cut here

00:00:26.635 --> 00:00:29.404
There’s no way they can lower my ego, I stick to my jutdae

00:00:29.404 --> 00:00:34.075
Horns get louder and grander, honk honk

00:00:34.076 --> 00:00:35.519
Here they come

00:00:35.519 --> 00:00:41.041
Villains make my blood boil and circulate throughout my body

00:00:41.041 --> 00:00:45.754
All eyes on the gathering of the famous Thunderous ones are

00:00:45.754 --> 00:00:51.592
Freezing cold but I know we'll burn forever

00:00:51.593 --> 00:00:54.120
I don't care how they look at me

00:00:54.121 --> 00:00:56.556
I'll always say what I have to say, Ptui, Ptui, Ptui

00:00:56.557 --> 00:00:59.226
Thunderous

00:00:59.226 --> 00:01:02.145
Thunderous (Ptui, Ptui, Ptui)

00:01:02.145 --> 00:01:04.272
Thunderous

00:01:04.273 --> 00:01:06.525
Man I’m not sorry, I’m dirty

00:01:06.525 --> 00:01:09.653
RUMBLE SNAP CRACK Thunder (Barababam)

00:01:09.653 --> 00:01:11.988
Riding on the clouds, tada (Barababam)

00:01:11.989 --> 00:01:14.074
The Thunderous one appears with the wind

00:01:14.074 --> 00:01:15.450
BANG BANG BANG BOOM

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.493
Man I’m not sorry, I’m dirty

00:01:17.494 --> 00:01:19.495
Keep on talking, we don’t play by the rules

00:01:19.496 --> 00:01:22.332
Yeah everybody's talking nonsense

00:01:22.332 --> 00:01:24.834
Tired of this and that, SMH SMH

00:01:24.835 --> 00:01:27.212
You talk too much, stop meddling

00:01:27.212 --> 00:01:30.131
Why you mad? Why you sad? Why you ticking me off

00:01:30.132 --> 00:01:31.007
I don’t care at all

00:01:31.008 --> 00:01:33.218
Neener-neener, your attempt to look cool is just cute

00:01:33.218 --> 00:01:36.304
You don’t even come close to me, this is my show

00:01:36.305 --> 00:01:37.648
Listen (What’s up?)

00:01:37.648 --> 00:01:38.799
Jealous (Guess they are)

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:41.142
Push everything aside and throw it away

00:01:41.143 --> 00:01:42.519
Here they come

00:01:42.519 --> 00:01:48.024
Villains make my blood boil and circulate throughout my body

00:01:48.025 --> 00:01:52.821
All eyes on the gathering of the famous Thunderous ones are

00:01:52.821 --> 00:01:58.535
Freezing cold but I know we'll burn forever

00:01:58.535 --> 00:02:01.079
I don't care how they look at me

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.781
I'll always say what I have to say, Ptui, Ptui, Ptui

00:02:03.782 --> 00:02:04.916
Hahaha

00:02:04.916 --> 00:02:07.710
Thunderous

00:02:07.711 --> 00:02:10.463
Thunderous (Ptui, Ptui, Ptui)

00:02:10.464 --> 00:02:12.632
Thunderous

00:02:12.633 --> 00:02:16.135
Man I’m not sorry, I’m dirty

00:02:16.136 --> 00:02:18.763
The Thunderous ones have arrived (huh)

00:02:18.764 --> 00:02:21.442
The Thunderous ones have arrived (Get out of the way)

00:02:21.442 --> 00:02:24.136
They don't come everyday

00:02:24.136 --> 00:02:26.771
The Thunderous ones have arrived

00:02:26.772 --> 00:02:29.383
I was born crooked, my voice can go against a hundred

00:02:29.483 --> 00:02:32.077
If I don’t like something, I'll talk back until I'm satisfied

00:02:32.077 --> 00:02:33.945
Final warning, immediately back up

00:02:33.945 --> 00:02:34.528
Spit it out

00:02:34.529 --> 00:02:35.279
Act tough

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.905
Back off

00:02:35.906 --> 00:02:38.325

00:02:46.016 --> 00:02:48.376
Man I’m not sorry, I’m dirty

00:02:48.377 --> 00:02:51.421
RUMBLE SNAP CRACK Thunder (Barababam)

00:02:51.421 --> 00:02:53.756
Riding on the clouds, tada (Barababam)

00:02:53.757 --> 00:02:55.758
The Thunderous one appears with the wind

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:57.302
BANG BANG BANG BOOM

00:02:57.302 --> 00:02:59.345
Man I’m not sorry, I’m dirty

00:02:59.346 --> 00:03:02.113
