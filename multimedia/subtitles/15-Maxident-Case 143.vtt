A new case, an unforgettable case

It’s full of stuff I want to tell you, my case

00:00:29.238 --> 00:00:31.323
There are no words that describe the perfection

00:00:31.323 --> 00:00:33.325
You got me losing patience

00:00:33.325 --> 00:00:35.702
The uncontrollable emotion

00:00:35.702 --> 00:00:38.329
You’re on my mind, I never feel alright

Numerous emotions collide, what’s going on

00:00:41.083 --> 00:00:43.710

My inner feelings again repeat (repeat)

00:02:17.462 --> 00:02:19.805
Walking next to you but I’m falling

I’m falling deeper I’m drawn to you

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:24.144
You’re pulling me deeper and deeper

00:02:24.144 --> 00:02:26.938

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:31.568
I recklessly dare to use cringy expressions

00:02:31.568 --> 00:02:33.820
My head is numb, cut away the emotionless thoughts

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.272
